      <description>Recap In the previous post we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed what Kafka is and how to interact with it. We explored how consumers subscribe to the topic and consume messages from it. We know that consumers form a group called consumer group and that Kafka split messages among members of the consumer group.
That&amp;rsquo;s of course after the initialization is finished, but what exactly is done in the background when you create a new consumer and call the very first poll?</description>

      <description>What is Kafka? Kafka is a popular stream-processing platform. What does it mean? You can think of it as a service that takes messages from one place and put it in another. It allows you to construct asynchronous processing of events, create pub-sub mechanism or distribute work evenly among worker services - the are many use cases for it.
Whatever your use case is, you need to know a few basic ideas about Kafka.</description>

      <description>Docker! That’s a real buzzword today! If you haven’t had a chance to use it yet, then you probably wonder what problems does it solve and if it can come in handy for you? Have you ever struggled with a problem of installing new software just for trying something out? Doing this regularly can lead to chaos in your OS not to mention the extra hassle of configuring more complex or coupled software (Wordpress with LAMP).</description>
