      <title>What does heartbeat thread do in Kafka Consumer?</title>

      <description>Recap In the previous post we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed how does Kafka Consumer work underneath. Now we know what are the very first steps to fetch records.
Remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally omitted from previous post? That&amp;rsquo;s right! Heartbeat thread. We will investigate what it does exactly and how it works in general.
Samples and setup If you want to run some samples on debug to discover heartbeat code by yourself, please by all means use my simple project on this GitHub repo.</description>

      <title>What happens when you call poll on Kafka Consumer?</title>

      <description>Recap In the previous post we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed what Kafka is and how to interact with it. We explored how consumers subscribe to the topic and consume messages from it. We know that consumers form a group called consumer group and that Kafka split messages among members of the consumer group.
That&amp;rsquo;s of course after the initialization is finished, but what exactly is done in the background when you create a new consumer and call the very first poll?</description>

      <description>What is Kafka? Kafka is a popular stream-processing platform. What does it mean? You can think of it as a service that takes messages from one place and put it in another. It allows you to construct asynchronous processing of events, create pub-sub mechanism or distribute work evenly among worker services - the are many use cases for it.
Whatever your use case is, you need to know a few basic ideas about Kafka.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Docker</title>

      <description>Docker! That’s a real buzzword today! If you haven’t had a chance to use it yet, then you probably wonder what problems does it solve and if it can come in handy for you? Have you ever struggled with a problem of installing new software just for trying something out? Doing this regularly can lead to chaos in your OS not to mention the extra hassle of configuring more complex or coupled software (Wordpress with LAMP).</description>
